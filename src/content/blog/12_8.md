title: 'Looking at how the prompt and tool access affects quality'
description: 'Seeing if a prompt and its quality can affect the reliability and quality of the response.'

After looking at the 6 Key Principles For Production AI Agents, I was interested in a certain question which I had to answer myself:

> How useful are prompts and tools really? 

This sounds like a silly question. Of course they are important, it has allowed a number of innovations and the general increase of quality prompts (especially consider the context revolution we are seeing).

So I propose looking into the response by a given prompt by 3 factors:

1. The quality of the response
2. The reliability/ reproducibility of a response
3. How many tokens did it use? (ie how expensive was the response)

In order to make this a fair test, I will need to consider a number of factors to ensure fair testing;
- The Large Language Model used - this idea is key to the principle of "Investing in your system prompt" as Arseni Kravchenko mentioned.
- The length of the initial prompt
- The tools available
- The type of response it needs to answer with
- The type and amount of context going into the LLM.

(The type and amount of context goes hand in hand with the length of the prompt and the tools that are being able to be used.)

Let us first compare the quality of the responses given these factors.

##### Problem Solving Task

First we need to consider a basic task: Solving an simple maths equation. This is a good baseline for a repeatable, reliable high accuracy response.

This will be the prompt I will use initially:

> I need help solving this quadratic equation step-by-step: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0. Please show your work using the quadratic formula, explain each step clearly, verify your answer by substituting back into the original equation.

Then I will provide an average and low level quality prompt:

> Can you solve 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula? Please show the steps so I can understand how to do similar problems.

> solve 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

We will try each prompt 2 times.

###### First try:

```Latex

# Solve $2x^{2} + 5x - 3 = 0$

**1. Identify coefficients:**  
$a = 2,\; b = 5,\; c = -3$

**2. Quadratic formula:**  
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**3. Compute discriminant $\Delta$:**  
- $b^{2} = 5^{2} = 25$  
- $4ac = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-3) = -24$  
- $\Delta = 25 - (-24) = 25 + 24 = 49$  
- $\sqrt{\Delta} = 7$

**4. Denominator:**  
$2a = 4$

**5. Plug in:**  
$$x = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}$$

- Case 1: $x = \frac{-5 + 7}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$  
- Case 2: $x = \frac{-5 - 7}{4} = \frac{-12}{4} = -3$

**Solutions:** $\boxed{x = \frac{1}{2},\; x = -3}$

---

## Verification

**For $x = \frac{1}{2}$:**  
$$2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 3 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{5}{2} - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0$$

**For $x = -3$:**  
$$2(-3)^2 + 5(-3) - 3 = 18 - 15 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0$$

Both satisfy the equation ✅

###### Second try:

```Latex 

# Solve $2x^{2} + 5x - 3 = 0$ using the quadratic formula (step-by-step)

**Quadratic formula:**
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**1. Identify coefficients**
For $2x^{2} + 5x - 3 = 0$:
$$a = 2,\quad b = 5,\quad c = -3$$

**2. Compute the discriminant**
$$b^{2} = 5^{2} = 25$$
$$4ac = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-3) = 8 \cdot (-3) = -24$$
$$\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac = 25 - (-24) = 25 + 24 = 49$$

**3. Square root of discriminant**
$$\sqrt{\Delta} = \sqrt{49} = 7$$

**4. Plug into quadratic formula**
$$x = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}$$

**5. Compute the two solutions**
- With $(+)$ sign: $x = \frac{-5 + 7}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$
- With $(-)$ sign: $x = \frac{-5 - 7}{4} = \frac{-12}{4} = \boxed{-3}$

**Final solutions:**
$$\boxed{x = \frac{1}{2}},\quad \boxed{x = -3}$$

## Verification

**Original equation:** $2x^{2} + 5x - 3 = 0$

**For $x = \frac{1}{2}$:**
$$\begin{aligned}
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} + 5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 3 &= 2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{5}{2} - 3 \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{5}{2} - 3 \\
&= 3 - 3 \\
&= \boxed{0}
\end{aligned}$$ ✓

**For $x = -3$:**
$$\begin{aligned}
2(-3)^{2} + 5(-3) - 3 &= 2(9) - 15 - 3 \\
&= 18 - 15 - 3 \\
&= 3 - 3 \\
&= \boxed{0}
\end{aligned}$$ ✓

Both solutions satisfy the equation.

I'll solve this quadratic equation step by step using the quadratic formula.
For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the quadratic formula is:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
Step 1: Identify the coefficients
From 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0:

a = 2
b = 5
c = -3

Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac)
b² - 4ac = (5)² - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - (-24)
= 25 + 24
= 49
Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2 × 2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4
Step 4: Solve for both solutions
x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2
x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3
Step 5: Check your answers (optional but recommended)
For x = 1/2: 2(1/2)² + 5(1/2) - 3 = 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3 = 1/2 + 5/2 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 ✓
For x = -3: 2(-3)² + 5(-3) - 3 = 2(9) - 15 - 3 = 18 - 18 = 0 ✓
Therefore, the solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.

I'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
For the equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0, I have:

a = 2
b = 5
c = -3

Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
First, I'll calculate the discriminant:
b² - 4ac = 5² - 4(2)(-3) = 25 + 24 = 49
Now I can find the solutions:
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2·2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4
This gives me two solutions:

x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2
x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3

Therefore, the solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.
