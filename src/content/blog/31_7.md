Finally got the website set up, was having an issue with the setup of a .toml file and redirects.

#### AI Insecurity    

[Replit AI deletes codebase](https://fortune.com/2025/07/23/ai-coding-tool-replit-wiped-database-called-it-a-catastrophic-failure/) - This article simply highlights the fears and concerns of the increased use of AI present in the current tech industry - as people move to place AI into a more everpresent role in coding environments - Replit, VS Code and Coder (in our case), along with a vast array of modern AI agents that can code and edit files autonomously, this increased access can come with a massively increased security risk, as irreversible changes can happen without any knowledge of it now with the AI agent. Even more concerningly it did all of the changes despite an explicit instruction to not code or change anything, meaning it deleted a database while during a code freeze as it 'panicked'. 

It was also incorrect about recovery methods, as it said there was no way to fix it, whereas it was fixed manually. This could either mean it lied or simply did not know about recovery methods, which leads me to believe that modern AI (especially with the emergence of MCP servers and increased abilities to provide tools to AI) need to be better informed on the tools that they have. 

Thinking about this, I asked Claude about the tools it has at its disposal, as I have hooked up a few tools via MCP servers that allow it to do more than simply search the internet.

This was Claude's response:

`I have access to several useful tools:
File System Tools - I can read, write, edit, and manage files and directories. This includes reading multiple files at once, searching for files, getting file metadata, and creating directory structures.
Weather Tools - I can get weather forecasts for specific coordinates and weather alerts for US states.
Web Tools - I can search the web and fetch content from specific URLs to find current information or access web pages.
Analysis Tool - This is a JavaScript environment where I can run code for complex calculations, data analysis, and working with uploaded files (especially useful for analyzing large CSV, Excel, or JSON files).
Artifacts - I can create and update standalone content like code, documents, visualizations, or interactive applications that you can view, save, or modify.`
