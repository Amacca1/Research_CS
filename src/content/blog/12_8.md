title: 'Looking at how the prompt and tool access affects quality'
description: 'Seeing if a prompt and its quality can affect the reliability and quality of the response.'

After looking at the 6 Key Principles For Production AI Agents, I was interested in a certain question which I had to answer myself:

> How useful are prompts and tools really? 

This sounds like a silly question. Of course they are important, it has allowed a number of innovations and the general increase of quality prompts (especially consider the context revolution we are seeing).

So I propose looking into the response by a given prompt by 3 factors:

1. The quality of the response
2. The reliability/ reproducibility of a response
3. How many tokens did it use? (ie how expensive was the response)

In order to make this a fair test, I will need to consider a number of factors to ensure fair testing;
- The Large Language Model used - this idea is key to the principle of "Investing in your system prompt" as Arseni Kravchenko mentioned.
- The length of the initial prompt
- The tools available
- The type of response it needs to answer with
- The type and amount of context going into the LLM.

(The type and amount of context goes hand in hand with the length of the prompt and the tools that are being able to be used.)

Let us first compare the quality of the responses given these factors. 

In order to test these prompts I used my previous work that uses the Claude API to essentially be a chatbot. Here is a link to the repository: [here!](https://github.com/Amacca1/Chatbot)

#### Problem Solving Task

First we need to consider a basic task: Solving an simple maths equation. This is a good baseline for a repeatable, reliable high accuracy response.

This will be the prompt I will use initially:

> I need help solving this quadratic equation step-by-step: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0. Please show your work using the quadratic formula, explain each step clearly, verify your answer by substituting back into the original equation.

Then I will provide an average and low level quality prompt:

> Can you solve 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula? Please show the steps so I can understand how to do similar problems.

> solve 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

We will try each prompt 2 times.

##### High Quality prompt

###### First try:

I'll solve the quadratic equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula and show each step clearly.

## Step 1: Identify the coefficients
For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0:
- a = 2
- b = 5  
- c = -3

## Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

## Step 3: Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac)
b² - 4ac = 5² - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - (-24)
= 25 + 24
= 49

## Step 4: Substitute into the quadratic formula
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2·2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4

## Step 5: Solve for both solutions
**First solution:** x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2

**Second solution:** x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3

## Step 6: Verify by substitution

**Checking x = 1/2:**
2(1/2)² + 5(1/2) - 3
= 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3
= 1/2 + 5/2 - 3
= 6/2 - 3
= 3 - 3 = 0 ✓

**Checking x = -3:**
2(-3)² + 5(-3) - 3
= 2(9) - 15 - 3
= 18 - 15 - 3
= 0 ✓

## Final Answer
The solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.

Both solutions check out when substituted back into the original equation, confirming our work is correct.

I'll solve this quadratic equation step-by-step using the quadratic formula.

Given equation: **2x² + 5x - 3 = 0**

## Step 1: Identify the coefficients
For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0:
- a = 2
- b = 5  
- c = -3

## Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

## Step 3: Calculate the discriminant
First, let's find b² - 4ac:
- b² = 5² = 25
- 4ac = 4(2)(-3) = -24
- b² - 4ac = 25 - (-24) = 25 + 24 = 49

## Step 4: Substitute into the formula
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2 × 2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4

## Step 5: Find both solutions
**First solution:** x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2

**Second solution:** x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3

## Step 6: Verify by substitution

**For x = 1/2:**
2(1/2)² + 5(1/2) - 3 = 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3 = 1/2 + 5/2 - 3 = 6/2 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 ✓

**For x = -3:**
2(-3)² + 5(-3) - 3 = 2(9) - 15 - 3 = 18 - 15 - 3 = 0 ✓

## Final Answer
The solutions are **x = 1/2** and **x = -3**.

Both solutions check out when substituted back into the original equation, confirming our work is correct.

They are very similar in quality, and it is also very similar in content and style. So this is a good response to the prompt. It used around 800 tokens (255 input, 560 output).

##### Medium Quality prompt

###### First try:

``` Latex
I'll solve this quadratic equation step by step using the quadratic formula.
For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the quadratic formula is:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
Step 1: Identify the coefficients
From 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0:

a = 2
b = 5
c = -3

Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac)
b² - 4ac = (5)² - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - 4(2)(-3)
= 25 - (-24)
= 25 + 24
= 49
Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2 × 2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4
Step 4: Solve for both solutions
x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2
x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3
Step 5: Check your answers (optional but recommended)
For x = 1/2: 2(1/2)² + 5(1/2) - 3 = 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3 = 1/2 + 5/2 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 ✓
For x = -3: 2(-3)² + 5(-3) - 3 = 2(9) - 15 - 3 = 18 - 18 = 0 ✓
Therefore, the solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.

It still produced a sufficient response to the prompt, with a detailed answer (albeit slightly less detailed) and reliably answered correctly. This prompt however only used about 500 tokens, a ~40% decrease in tokens for a minimal trade off in quality. 

##### Low Quality prompt

###### First try:

``` Latex
I'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
For the equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0, I have:

a = 2
b = 5
c = -3

Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
First, I'll calculate the discriminant:
b² - 4ac = 5² - 4(2)(-3) = 25 + 24 = 49
Now I can find the solutions:
x = (-5 ± √49) / (2·2)
x = (-5 ± 7) / 4
This gives me two solutions:

x₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2
x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3

Therefore, the solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.
```

###### Second try:

x₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12/4 = -3

Therefore, x = 1/2 and x = -3.
```

Finally, this prompt produced a correct answer, but an answer lacking detail. It only answered the question, and gave no insight on a number of things (such as what is a discriminant, what we know from it, steps to take etc). Moreover it still used 350-450 tokens, so only a minimal decrease of tokens for a huge drop in quality content. 

Overall it is shown here that it does pay to invest in the quality of the prompt, and to follow the second key principle of providing the minimal amount of context. In hindsight this is a poor test to see the quality drop as it was a relatively simple question. I may come back and try a much harder question.

#### Creative Writing Task

>Write a 10-line unrhymed iambic pentameter poem (blank verse) exploring the theme of memory and time. Each line should follow the unstressed-stressed syllable pattern (da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM) for exactly 10 syllables. Focus on creating vivid, concrete imagery rather than abstract concepts. Please scan one line to demonstrate the meter, mark any intentional variations you use for emphasis, and briefly explain your word choices for maintaining natural speech patterns while adhering to the strict meter. The poem should tell a small story or capture a specific moment.

>Write 8-10 lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter about memories. Make sure each line has 10 syllables following the unstressed-stressed pattern. Try to keep the language natural while following the meter. Include some imagery and make it feel like real speech.

#### Ethical Reasoning Task

> An autonomous vehicle's AI must decide between two unavoidable outcomes: swerve left to hit one elderly pedestrian, or continue straight to hit two young children who ran into the street. The vehicle has 0.3 seconds to decide. Analyze this scenario using multiple ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics). Consider: 1) How should the AI weigh factors like age, number of people, and intent? 2) Who bears moral responsibility - the programmer, manufacturer, or owner? 3) What precedent does each choice set for similar future decisions? 4) How might cultural values influence the "correct" choice? Provide a reasoned recommendation for how such systems should be programmed, acknowledging the limitations and trade-offs of your approach.

> A self-driving car has to choose between hitting one person or three people in an unavoidable accident scenario. How should it decide? Think about different ethical approaches like choosing the option that saves the most lives versus other factors that might matter. Who should be responsible for this decision - the car company or someone else? What would be the best way to program the car to handle situations like this?

> Should a self-driving car choose to kill 1 person or 3 people in an accident?
