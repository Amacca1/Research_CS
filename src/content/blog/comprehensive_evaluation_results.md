## Conclusion

The RRF system demonstrates **excellent technical performance** with 100% activation rate and comprehensive source integration, representing a major achievement in multi-strategy search fusion. However, **critical content quality issues** require immediate attention, particularly the lack of verbatim citations and potential fabrication of responses not grounded in source material.

**Priority**: Fix context passing mechanism to ensure actual document content reaches the response generation system while maintaining the proven RRF search capabilities.

**Status**: RRF infrastructure is fully operational and ready for optimization.
