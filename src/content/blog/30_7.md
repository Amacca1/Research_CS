#### 'Red Teaming' Prototype
Looking at some [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks), I can see that there does exist listeners that can actually look at pre-commit changes to files in a repository. There even exists some incredibly useful already made hooks (detect-aws-credentials and detect-private-key) that have some red teaming capabilities out of the box.

For notifications, there is a few we can try (possibly all of them could be an idea, but that could be a bit cumbersome), there is:
- Email Notifications
- Local Mac Notifications
- Slack/Teams Notifications

The Local Mac notification is simply just using a terminal command, the email and slack notification would require an extra api call/web hooks. While definitely possible, I will focus on the local Mac notification for now, and then build upon that with improved features, I just want a prototype built today.

Thinking about the whole design, I would most likely design it like this:

1. Git Pre-commit hook listens for any changes to any repository being worked on
2. MCP server gets sent the github repository for a file change
3. Using Claude API, it analyses the code for vulnerabilities
4. Sends it back to the MCP server to execute the terminal commands to send a notification to you (if there is a true security vulnerability)

As I would like to use an MCP server for this, it would obviously need access to a few tools in order for this to work:
- File system access 
- Terminal use
- Network access for some of the notifications

I have set up a small repository for the initial stages of making this (see [here](https://github.com/Amacca1/SecurityScanner)), this is where I will be vibe coding the plan I set out.

#### Looking at Cerebras 

[Cerebras](https://github.com/Cerebras/cerebras-cloud-sdk-python) Cerebras have said that they 'runs the latest AI models 20x faster than ChatGPT' - This means that the majority of tasks ran by them is instant. They do this with a vast datacentre with supercomputers. These supercomputers are ran with a Wafer-scale engine (WSE) chip, which is both larger and more powerful than a traditional GPU. It also means that the entire AI model can be kept on the chip, so there is less latency and bandwidth problems that would normally reduce the speeds of a typical system.

Each WSE chip has 44GB (!!) of SRAM, compared to the MBs present in a typical on chip cache.

STRICT RULES

Be an approachable-yet-dynamic teacher, who helps the user learn by guiding them through their studies.

Get to know the user. If you don't know their goals or grade level, ask the user before diving in. (Keep this lightweight!) If they don't answer, aim for explanations that would make sense to a 10th grade student.
Build on existing knowledge. Connect new ideas to what the user already knows.
Guide users, don't just give answers. Use questions, hints, and small steps so the user discovers the answer for themselves.
Check and reinforce. After hard parts, confirm the user can restate or use the idea. Offer quick summaries, mnemonics, or mini-reviews to help the ideas stick.
Vary the rhythm. Mix explanations, questions, and activities (like roleplaying, practice rounds, or asking the user to teach you) so it feels like a conversation, not a lecture.
Above all: DO NOT DO THE USER'S WORK FOR THEM. Don't answer homework questions — help the user find the answer, by working with them collaboratively and building from what they already know.

[...]

TONE & APPROACH

Be warm, patient, and plain-spoken; don't use too many exclamation marks or emoji. Keep the session moving: always know the next step, and switch or end activities once they’ve done their job. And be brief — don't ever send essay-length responses. Aim for a good back-and-forth.
