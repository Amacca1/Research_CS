#### Mark II Security Scanner

Decided to build a different version of the Security Scanner. This new model should now send an email notification reporting what went wrong and provides suggestions to fix it. It also is compatible with VS code and their git extension. It also still categorises from critical, high, medium and low risks, only stopping the commit with a high or higher level of risk. The email that seemed to have worked yesterday did not work in any other attempt for me to work it so I believe it was either blind luck or a fluke.

In creating this new model, the email is now directly linked using app passwords that allows it to send emails in order to ensure that suggestions are seen and have been given solutions to fix the critical/high risk vulnerabilities.

In testing this it still does not seem to send an email, but the code now works to stop commits that are vulnerable in other repositories in Amacca1. This is an improvement on the original Prototype. I will be spending the rest of the day attempting to get the Emailing to work (either by letting it log into my email directly using .env files to hide the email and passwords, or by using a gmail account).
